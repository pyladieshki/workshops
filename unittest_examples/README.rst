Why writing **tests**?

1.  The code **works** if the tests **pass**. No need to overthink. -> savings of time & effort

2.  Visual feedback -- we all like to see some results

3.  Tests help you in **documenting** things, as well as breaking things down into smaller pieces

4.  Last, but not least -- they save you from potentially of *hours of debugging*!

5.  It is a wrong belief to assume that writing tests requires a lot of time and effort. In the long run they DO save you time!


**Best practices** to running unit tests

a.  Each test must be independent from the rest (e.g., no order of running dependency)

b.  Test one condition only!

c.  Same results must be observed on every run

d.  Naming convention: test classes should start with the word "Test". The class methods must start with the word "test" and then must be followed by descriptive words of what you are testing.

e.  It is better to have slow tests, than no tests at all!
