Why writing tests?

1.  The code works if the tests pass. No need to overthink. -> savings of time & effort
2.  Visual feedback -- we all like to see some results
3.  Tests help you in documenting things, as well as breaking things down into smaller pieces
4.  Last, but not least -- they save you from potentially of hours of debugging!
